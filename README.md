# Expensive.

### A janky, ugly and occasionally rude daily expenses tracker

This program will allow users to add and keep track their daily expenses, and can also 
give personalized alerts/reminders when their spending goes over a certain amount, which can be set by the user.
Reminders can range from nice, gentle reminders to roasting and PG insults, depending on what the user sets. *Expensive.* 
can be used by anyone who wants to track of their daily spending habits and may require more motivation to not
spend money unnecessarily. My motivation to make this project stemmed from how I always wondered why my bank account 
balance was so low after every month. After printing a monthly balance statement, I realized how much money I wasted on 
unnecessary, impulse driven purchases such as fast food, clothing, subscriptions or trips out with friends. 
With the cost living continuing to rise and wages not rising to meet the cost, I hope that this application
will allow people to give a second sober thought about spending money impulsively.
