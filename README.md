# Expensive.

### A janky, ugly and occasionally rude daily expenses tracker

This program will allow users to add and keep track their daily expenses, and can also 
give personalized alerts/reminders when their spending goes over a certain amount, which can be set by the user.  
*Expensive.* be used by anyone who wants to track of their daily spending habits and may require more motivation to not
spend money unnecessarily. My motivation to make this project stemmed from how I always wondered why my bank account 
balance was so low after every month. After printing a monthly balance statement, I realized how much money I wasted on 
unnecessary, impulse driven purchases, such as fast food, clothing or trips out with friends. Especially in these modern times 
with an increasing cost of living, people need to start saving up more and more just to buy basic goods and needs, I
hope that this app will allow people to be more aware about their daily expenses.
